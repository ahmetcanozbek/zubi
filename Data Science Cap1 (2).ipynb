    "In this project I will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Italian restaurant in Berlin, Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in Berlin we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Italian restaurants in area. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n"
